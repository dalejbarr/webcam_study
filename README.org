- /Note/: the experimental design is completely described by data
  contained in the tables =EESP4_Speaker.db=.  This will also contain
  some of the behavioral data that will be collected.  Sessions 1-40
  are the main experimental sessions; sessions 1000-1039 are for
  piloting/experimenter practice only.

- For privacy reasons, the sound files containing directors' spoken
  responses will not be included in the repository.  Instead, we will
  post the transcriptions along with the speech coding

* Running the experiment

- To run the experiment you will need two PCs running Ubuntu Linux
  14.04.1 LTS 64-bit (one for the director and one for the matcher) in
  adjacent rooms, each connected to a monitor set to a resolution of
  1280 x 1024 pixels.  Connect a webcam from the matchers' computer to
  a USB port on the director's computer.  You will also need sound
  equipment to reproduce our audio setup (we have two mixing boards,
  one with a crossfader, two microphones, and three headphones).
  Create a folder =director/= in the main user's home directory on the
  director's computer.  Copy the files from =common/= and =director/=
  into that directory, in addition to =data_raw/EESP4_Speaker.db= and
  =data_raw/EESP4_Practice_Speaker.db=.  On the matchers' computer
  create a directory =matcher/= in the main user's home directory, and
  copy in the contents of =common/= and =matcher/= along with the
  files =data_raw/EESP4_Listener.db= and
  =data_raw/EESP4_Practice_Listener.db=.  You will also need to change
  an entry in the =EXPConfig= table of the =EESP4_Speaker.db= and
  =EESP4_Practice_Speaker.db= databases.  Currently the entry for
  =SOCKET_CLIENT= is =1 yap:4545=; 'yap' is the name of the matcher's
  computer on our local network.  Change this to the name or IP
  address of the computer on your own network.  You will also need to
  update the host name in =director/run_matcher.sh=.

- To launch the experiment, open a terminal window and go to
  =director/=.  Type =./run.sh XXXX= substituting the session number
  (1-40) for XXXX.  This will also launch the experiment on the
  matcher's PC.
